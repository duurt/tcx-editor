# Welcome to the TCX Editor project
## Intro
I wanted to be able to have turn-by-turn navigation instructions on my Wahoo Elemnt Bolt (a bike computer) for routes that are created with the Strava route builder. This is not supported by default, but this app allows you to add the navigation cues, or any other points of interest on the route yourself.

## How does it work?
In short, here are the steps to follow:
1.  Create a route with the Strava route builder
2.  Export it as a `.tcx` file
