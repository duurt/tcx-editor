# Hello, and Welcome to the TCX Editor project!
## Why this TCX Editor?
I wanted to be able to have turn-by-turn navigation instructions on my Wahoo Elemnt Bolt (a bike computer) for routes that are created with the Strava route builder. This is not supported by default, but this app allows you to add the navigation cues, or any other points of interest on the route yourself.

## Getting started
Go to [https://github.com/duurt/tcx-editor/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/duurt/tcx-editor/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download the `.zip`. Extract it anywhere you like and run the file `TcxEditor.UI.exe`.

## How does it work?
In short, here are the steps to follow:
1.  Create a route with the Strava route builder and export it as a `.tcx` file
2.  Add the navigation cues to the route with the TCX Editor
3.  Save the file and upload it to the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt...

Enjoy the ride!
